# KeyTerms
## A JavaScript Package for History Students

History is full of dictatorships. It's a fact that one learns throughout High School. But
what they don't tell you about history is that the class in which one studies it is also
a dictatorship. Many history teachers like to force their students to write "key terms"
or "Identifications" of various people and events throughout history. Now, this is all well
and good, but the dictators are stuck in the obsolete mindset that _everything_ must be
handwritten. This is simply not the case for many tech-affluent students, who learn much
more effectively through computer use.

Thus, a package is needed to ease their troubles. Enter `keyterms`, the package for you!
`keyterms` allows you to pre-type all of the definitions for your key terms, and it then
serves a webpage made from your document, which allows you to easily track which key terms
you have and haven't written out, and will greatly ease the difficult process of handwriting
your terms. Additionally, `keyterms` can serve another webpage made from the same document
that allows you to study your key terms in much the same way that Quizlet does.
